Overview
========

* Public key management
* Man-in-the-middle and other attacks
* Jython support - providing an OpenSSL-based API on top of Java


About me
========

* Racker on the Auto Scaling team
* Core developer of Jython
* Co-author of *Definitive Guide to Jython* from Apress
* Lecturer in CS at Univ of Colorado at Boulder - "Principles of Programming Languages"
* Leader, Boulder/Denver Storm Users meetup
* Formerly, part of original developer team of Ubuntu Juju - lots of experience with ZooKeeper


Background in SSL
=================

* Knew fundamentals


Fundamentals
============

* Symmetric encryption - AES, formerly DES, 3DES
* Public key encryption - based on asymmetric functions
* Factorization vs multiplication, discrete log, elliptic curve
* SSL starts with public keys, negotiates a onetime symmetric key for session


Public keys
===========

* Want everyone want to know your public keys
* Wrapped in a certificate, signed by...
     - Me
     - Others - works in a web of trust
     - Certificate authority


Background in SSL
=================

* Knew fundamentals
* Man-in-the-middle, other possible attacks


Man-in-the-middle
=================



Background in SSL
=================

* Knew fundamentals
* Man-in-the-middle
* But really just an informed user
* Not paying attention to actual vulnerabilities


`goto fail;`
============

* Most prominent recent example
* Apple SSL flaw


`goto fail;`
============

````c
static OSStatus
SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(
    SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa,
    SSLBuffer signedParams,
    uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)
{
    OSStatus        err;
    ...
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
        goto fail;
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
    ...

fail:
    SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);
    SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);
    return err;
}
````


Indented `goto fail;`
=====================

````c
static OSStatus
SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange(
    SSLContext *ctx, bool isRsa,
    SSLBuffer signedParams,
    uint8_t *signature, UInt16 signatureLen)
{
    OSStatus err;
    ...
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
    goto fail;  /* Not a problem in Python! */
    if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(...)) != 0)
        goto fail;
    ...

fail:
    SSLFreeBuffer(&signedHashes);
    SSLFreeBuffer(&hashCtx);
    return err;
}

Jython SSL
==========

* Need support now that Python ecosystem tools (pip, easy_install, etc) require it
* Cannot just say, use supporting Java API


Rabbit hole?
============

* Am I really the right person to work on this?
* I'm not a security expert
* I don't have time
* Really this is a question for **all of us**
* We do not need to re-implement algorithms - or devise new ones
* Need to use security carefully 


Java security model
===================

* Complex!
* Still doesn't suffice, so usually need to also use complementary Bouncy Castle
* `SSLContext`, `SSLEngine`
* `KeyManager`,	`TrustManager`


`KeyManager`
============

* Manages key **material**
* Example: private key and corresponding public key certificate
* Can be looked up as necessary by `SSLEngine` / `SSLContext`


`TrustManager`
==============

* Manages the trust of certificates
* Specific certificate validation (like `goto fail;` earlier)
* Certificate authorities and their root certificates


Don't do this!
==============

A recipe that has circulated and I have even used for testing:

````python
class TrustAllX509TrustManager(X509TrustManager):
    """Define a custom TrustManager to
       accept all certificates"""

    def checkClientTrusted(self, chain, auth):
        pass

    def checkServerTrusted(self, chain, auth):
        pass

    def getAcceptedIssuers(self):
        return None
````


Especially don't do this!
=========================

Making this be the default for all usages:

````python
trust_managers = array(
    TrustManager, [TrustAllX509TrustManager()])
trust_all_context = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL")
trust_all_context.init(None, trust_managers, None)
SSLContext.setDefault(trust_all_context)
````

Equivalent code in Python 2.7
=============================

From the docs:

> Warning The ssl module wonâ€™t validate certificates by default. When
  used in client mode, this means you are vulnerable to
  man-in-the-middle attacks.

````python
ssl.wrap_socket(sock, cert_reqs=CERT_NONE, ...)
````

Proper trust management
=======================

* Your solution should be closing security holes
* Do not introduce them
* So delegate


Delegation
==========

* Use `pip` or `easy_install` - they do the right thing
* Use `requests`
* Use the underlying security infrastructure, opening as necessary


Certificate pinning
===================

* Trust as little as possible
* Certificate authorities can be compromised
* If possible, don't use them
* Register your certs in Chrome; support in progress in Firefox
* Register your certs in your mobile app, your Python app


In Jython
=========

````python
class CompositeX509TrustManager(X509TrustManager):
  def __init__(self, trust_managers):
    self.trust_managers = trust_managers

  def checkClientTrusted(self, chain, auth_type):
    for trust_manager in self.trust_managers:
      try:
        trustManager.checkClientTrusted(
          chain, auth_type)
        return
      except CertificateException:
        pass
    raise CertificateException(
      "None of the TrustManagers trust cert chain")
...
````
